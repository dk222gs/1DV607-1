1 canlendar,

I think if you add a part of canlendar will be better.  
An event in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notable occurrence at a particular point in time.  
Events can, but do not necessarily, cause state transitions from one state to another in state machines represented by state machine diagrams.  
A transition between states occurs only when any guard condition for that transition are satisfied.

I think that you should descripe the boat and use a new form.


Thank you
