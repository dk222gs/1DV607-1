##What are the strong points of the model?

The model has great class names that all are nouns in singular. (Larman, section 9.5) and it follows the concept about visualizing things in real life, rather than about software objects. (Larman, section 9.2)

##What are the weaknesses of the model?

There is no clear relation between “Member” and “Event”


##As a developer would the model help you and why/why not?

Yes. The provided model gives a good and clear overview of the system and the classes it uses. It follows the visual standards given in the course literature and is easily understood.

##Do you think a domain expert would understand the model why/why not?

Good class names that are easy to understand with clear relations between them. Anyone with some knowledge about the domain should have no problem understanding this mode. It follows the rules from the course literature as stated in previous section of this review.

##Do you think the model has passed the grade 2 (passing grade) criteria?

Yes.
