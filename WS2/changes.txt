According to review by mo222mw I did further changes:

1.
"Having to choose between going back to menu or quitting the application after each operation seems redundant, only adding an extra button to press." 
- removed showOptions() method from Menu.java


According to review by mr222xu I did further changes:

1.
"Consider changing the dir member variable in the FileHandler class to e.g. “data” + File.separator[1] to cater for operating systems that have other file separators than slash."
- added File.separator() to FileHandler.java

2. 
"The verbose list doesn’t print the personal number/social security number"
- updated MenuActions.java to print SSN in verbose list

3.
"I think that the MenuActions class should  show a dependency to Member."
- added dependency

4.
"The return messages in the sequence diagrams should be depicted with an open arrow, and not a closed arrow"
- fixed (where appliable)




Additionally:
- I have reviewed my Class Diagram and removed all dependencies to BoatType enum, and moved them to Boat instead, since BoatType is an inner class of Boat.
